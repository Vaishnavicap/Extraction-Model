Q.54 Consider a system with 2 KB direct mapped data cache with a block size of 64 bytes. 
The system has a physical address space of 64 KB and a word length of 16 bits. 
During the execution of a program, four data words P, Q, R, and S are accessed in 
that order 10 times ( i.e., PQRSPQRS…). Hence, there are 40 accesses to data cache 
altogether. Assume that the data cache is initially empty and no other data words are 
accessed by the program. The addresses of the first bytes of P, Q, R, and S are
